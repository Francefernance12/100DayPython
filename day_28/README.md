# 100DayPython
<h3>Until the 100th day, I will be uploading 1 different project.</h3>
 
<hr />

<h3>Day 1</h3>
 <h4>Band Name Generator</h4>
 This is a straight-forward generator designed to generate a unique band name. You'll respond to a series of questions, 
and your answers will amalgamate into a distinctive band name for you.

<h4>What I Learned</h4>
- Strings
- Variables
- concatenations
- `print()` Method
- `inputs()` Method

<hr />
<h3>Day 2</h3>
  <h4>Tip Calculator</h4>
 I've developed a tip calculator that not only computes the total bill amount with the tip included but also facilitates
the calculation of individual shares for a bill split among multiple people. It's a convenient tool for simplifying the 
process when dining out with friends.

<h4>What I Learned</h4>
- Integers
- Floats
- Expressions
- Rounding numbers
- inputs
- `f` strings
- `if` statements

 
 <hr />
 <h3>Day 3</h3>
 <h4>Treasure Island</h4>
 This simple Adventure game lets players advance through the storyline by typing in their actions.
 
<h4>What I Learned</h4>
- Nested if statements
- if/else/ elif statements
- ASCII art
- using logic
 
 <hr />
 <h3>Day 4</h3> 
 <h4>Rock Paper Scissors</h4>
This is a simple game of rock, paper and scissors against the computer. 

<h4>What I Learned</h4>
- Lists
- Nested lists
- Selecting data from the list
- `len()` Method
- Random module(randint)
- `and` and `or` logic
- Chained Conditions
 
 <hr />
 <h3>Day 5</h3>
<h4>random password generator</h4>
  This project is a random password generator. It will take your inputs which are number of characters you want to put 
in your password. There are 3 different characters; letters, numbers, and symbols. After taking all the inputs. 
python will create the password for you.

<h3>Day 6</h3>
<h4>Empty</h4>
<hr />

<h3>Day 7</h3>
<h4>Hangman Game</h4>
This project involves creating a Hangman Gameâ€”a guessing game in which players attempt to deduce a word by guessing 
letters. Incorrect guesses result in a loss of life, while correct guesses fill in the blanks until the entire word is 
revealed.

<h4>What I Learned</h4>
- From/Import
- replacing/removing/placing elements in empty lists
- `lower` method


<hr />
<h3>Day 8</h3>
<h4>Caesar Cipher</h4>
The project is a Caesar Cipher generator. The Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique in cryptography where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
The User need to type in the words they want to encrypt or decrypt.
Then the User needs to type in the number of shifts to encrypt or decrypt.
After receiving the inputs, python should start displaying the User's encrypted or decrypted words.

<h4>What I Learned</h4>
- Def Functions
- handling out of range list error
- Positional/Keyword arguments


<hr />
<h3>Day 9</h3>
<h4>Blind Auction</h4>
A Blind Auction is Auction where the bidders cannot know the other bidder's bid.
The user will enter their names and place their bids.
The user will be asked if there is another bidder or not.
If user select `yes`, the screen should clear to hide the previous bid from the next bidder and so on.
If user select `no`, The bidder with the highest bid will be declared the winner.

<h4>What I Learned</h4>
- replit module(`clear`)
- Dictionaries
- `max()` method
- `get()` method
